{
    // A conceptual idea
    // An interaction point for a second player, where they can provide meaningful interaction into the game without needing full multiplayer
    
    // In this case, probably an xbox controller addon
    // Control a small drone that can move spherically around the ship and target/shoot things. 
    // could have a combat laser, could have a mining laser! 
    // Very simple, just move and shoot, but allows for at least some interaction by a second party
